Inspired by older RPG games from a young age, this is a CLI interface, randomly generated text adventure, where you encounter traps, monsters, and items 
while adventuring through a dark and mysterious dungeon with your highscores kept track off at the end of each adventure.

Can you beat xXTheAdventurerXx?

All that is needed to run it is to copy the repo and run the main.py file.
